# Tableau visualisations and dashboards
These are some of the dashboards I created to practice using Tableau as a visualisation and analysing tool.

## Dataset 1: Coffee Chain Sales Data
This exercise is to create visualisations and dashboard and provide analysing document to demonstrate the key insights and recommendations. 
1. Key insights on the performance of the coffee chain company based on the visualisations generated using Tableau
2. An interaction dashboard enables self-service business users with the capabilities to:
* Explore the profit vs sales of each market, states, and post-codes
* Explore which product invested more in marketing and whether or not that investment positively correspond to the profitability and sales of a particular product
* Conduct 'what if' scenarios to improve overall profitability of the company when decrease or increase the supply amount of particular products
3. Provide recommendation using the dashboard and any other visualisations

## Dataset 2: Coffee Chain Transactions Data
This exercise is to provide 2 interactive dashboards for the user to explore:
1. The performance of each outlet, including:
* The comparison of sales for each of the active outlets
* The most popular products for each of the active outlets
* Total of sales for the month of April and May for Coffee Bean and the total number of customers who made a purchase during those months
2. The transactions and customers' consumption, including:
* The top 5 customers (registered in the loyalty program) in terms of purchases and the total spend they made on monthly basis
* The comparison of dine-in and take-away in terms of volume of transactions and $ value of the transactions
* Thich time of the day is generally busier

## Dataset 3: Motor Corporation Sales Data
This exercise is to clean the data using Tableau Prep Builder and develop multiple dashboards including performance, financial, operations and forcasting of the Motor Corporation.
